# CS-370
For this project, I developed a Treasure Hunt Game that applies core principles of reinforcement learning and maze navigation. This project showcases my ability to design and implement intelligent agents capable of interacting with dynamic environments to achieve set goals.

Work Completed
The project began with foundational code for maze generation and basic game mechanics. Key contributions and enhancements include:

Game Logic Implementation: I extended the functionality of the maze and game interaction by refining the algorithms in GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py. This involved structuring the environment and managing the agent's actions within the maze.
Reinforcement Learning Integration: Implemented Q-learning through the Jupyter Notebook, Caleb_Green_Project2.ipynb, which trains the agent to navigate and find the optimal path in the maze.
Experience Replay: Developed the GameExperience class to manage past experiences, enabling the model to learn from previous actions and improve its decision-making process.
Testing and Evaluation: Conducted multiple simulations to refine the agent's behavior and measure performance, ensuring the maze completion rate improved over time.
Connection to Computer Science Principles
This project connects directly to essential computer science and AI concepts, such as:

Reinforcement Learning – The project implements Q-learning, one of the fundamental algorithms in artificial intelligence, to train the agent on optimal maze navigation strategies.
Algorithm Design – The maze generation and action-selection processes reflect core algorithmic problem-solving techniques, reinforcing skills in designing and optimizing complex systems.
State Management – By developing the agent's ability to store and recall past experiences, the project mirrors real-world applications of neural networks and memory replay in dynamic environments.
Ethical Considerations
Developing AI-driven systems requires attention to:

Algorithm Fairness – Ensuring the agent operates without bias and generalizes well across different maze configurations.
Transparency – Documenting the training process and maze generation logic allows for reproducibility and clarity in system behavior.
User Experience – Designing the game to provide informative feedback on agent performance fosters engagement and helps users understand AI decision-making processes.
This project exemplifies the application of reinforcement learning in a structured environment, reinforcing my understanding of AI-driven problem-solving and strengthening my skills in designing intelligent systems.
