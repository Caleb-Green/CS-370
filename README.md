# CS-370
For this project, I completed and enhanced the functionality of a dashboard for Grazioso Salvare, a fictional company. Starting with the provided starter code, I implemented several key changes and additions to demonstrate the application of reinforcement learning and neural networks to a real-world problem involving data management and analysis.

Work Completed
The starter code included a Jupyter Notebook file, a dataset (aac_shelter_outcomes.csv), and supporting documentation. My contributions involved:

Data Handling Enhancements: Expanded the notebook to include integration with MongoDB for data retrieval and manipulation. I implemented functionality to parse and analyze data efficiently, as demonstrated by the logs and outputs in the completed notebook.
CRUD Operations: Created a new CRUD_module.py file to support database operations. This addition streamlined the process of managing the dataset and interacting with MongoDB.
Visualization and Reporting: Enhanced the notebook with additional code for data visualization and reporting, ensuring that the processed data could be interpreted easily.
Connection to Computer Science Principles
This project embodies core computer science concepts, including:

Data Management: The integration with MongoDB and the handling of large datasets align with database management and data processing techniques essential in modern applications.
Reinforcement Learning: By leveraging neural networks and data processing techniques, the project demonstrates how AI can make informed decisions based on historical data.
Problem-Solving Approach: The work required identifying gaps in the starter code and systematically addressing them with new functionality.
Ethical Implications
In developing systems that handle sensitive data, it is critical to consider:

Data Privacy: Ensuring that the system adheres to data protection standards to avoid misuse.
Bias Mitigation: Implementing algorithms that are fair and do not propagate existing biases in the dataset.
User Transparency: Providing clear explanations for system recommendations to foster trust among users.
In summary, this project reflects the practical application of computer science principles to solve real-world problems, highlighting my ability to approach challenges systematically and ethically.
